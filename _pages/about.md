I am a research assistant at THUNLP Lab, Tsinghua University. I am fortunately co-advised by [Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/index_cn.html), and [Xu Han](https://thucsthanxu13.github.io/). Before that, I received my B.E. in Computer Science from [Tianjin University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm), advised by Prof.[Ruifang He](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/info/1099/2746.htm). My research interests include unsupervised learning and transfer learning in natural language processing. 



Publication
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)

Site-wide configuration
------
 [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
